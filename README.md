👋 Hi, I'm Jareer Umar

I'm a backend-focused .NET developer who builds clean, scalable, and maintainable applications using ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL Server.

I have hands-on experience working on real-world systems, including refactoring legacy codebases into service-based clean architecture using dependency injection, building REST APIs, and delivering full-stack applications with React and TypeScript.

I enjoy solving backend problems, improving code quality, and building systems that are reliable and easy to maintain.
